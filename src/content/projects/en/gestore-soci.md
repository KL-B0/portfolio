It's a desktop management application built for [Associazione NoiSea](https://www.associazionenoisea.eu/) of the [Linate Airport](https://www.milanairports.com/en).

It features:

1. Associate management (CRUD)
2. Agreement generation and printing

## Goal

The aim is to build a desktop application which allows for associate management and the automatic generation of documents available for printing.
The generation works with the associate data already stored within the system.

## Resources

I had to deliver a finished product in two weeks.
I picked Java and the Swing UI toolkit because of my familiarity with those technologies.
I also selected the MySQL relational database system to store the associate data.

## Timeline

The main milestones I accomplished were:

1. Design
2. Development

### Design

I designed a simple yet effective user interface that allowed the administrative staff to insert and update information about associates.
It offered support for registering services and printing pre-filled documents.

### Development

I list below the main tasks I performed:

1. E/R schema and logical schema definition
2. Database configuration and data importing
3. User interface assembly
4. Business logic assembly, which included:
   - CRUD operations
   - Document printing operation
5. Bundling

## Result

I submitted the project on time, which satisfied all the business requirements.

## Conclusion

I learnt to listen to customer requirements during this experience, which shaped the design of the software application.
It's crucial to fix the time and goal for each project to make the most of one's resources.
