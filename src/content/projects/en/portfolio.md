It's a static website which features my work, built to be performant and responsive.

It features:

- Superior performance
- Responsive layout
- Accessibility
- SEO
- Light and dark themes
- Internationalization (English + Italian)

## Goal

The aim is to build a website which features all the projects Iâ€™ve worked on.
It should be accessible from any device by a national and international audience.

The project must also be easy to maintain; adding new content should require little effort.

## Resources

The intent is to pick technologies which help me reach the goal in a reasonable amount of time.

I opted for a Static Site Generator (SSG) since the website does not require frequent updates.
I originally picked Hugo as the generator but later switched to Astro for ease of development.
The switch came at a cost, but the tooling and final product quality made up for it.
This meant I could integrate a front-end framework to add reactivity to the website.

I picked TailwindCSS to build and maintain the styles.
It is officially supported by the Astro framework, which simplifies its adoption.
I selected the Lucide icon set and the IBM Plex Serif font.

Making sure I am not making notable missteps along the development is no easy duty.
I employed TypeScript and a CI/CD workflow to check code consistency.

## Timeline

The main achievements I accomplished were:

1. Design
2. Development
3. Writing
4. Launching

The whole process took me two weeks of work.

## Result

The website you are currently visiting is the end product of this project.
If you are curious about how it works under the hood, you can find the links to the source code at the bottom of this page.

## Conclusion

A personal website is an outstanding opportunity to showcase your own skills.
It will make your work visible from a web search of your name, building relationships with new potential collaborators.
I would call it a improved business card!
